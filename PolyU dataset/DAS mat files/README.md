Because GitHub has a limit of 100MB for file upload size, in order to facilitate the download of the files, we have placed them on Google Drive. The DAS mat files can be quickly downloaded from the link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AABKO_ugMzKqAa1gOQZSpwqreekb-I-_?usp=sharing
The openSourceDataForTrafficMonitoring.m can read mat files into your workspace.
